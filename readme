This is a prototype of a Image generating GAN network. 

Currently sending feedback to the generating network is the big issue.

To see an overview of the two competing networks see the images provided in the repository.

How is the training data treated?
  - Images scraped from google images
  - All images in the dataset resized to 75x75
  - Only kept jpeg images 
  - Changes images to grayscale and appends to appropriate array
  - Changes into NP array for keras use. 
  - Grayscale and image size used to speed up testing

Challenges faced / Next Steps
  - How to do recognise features (Used improper R-CNN model)
  - Built the wrong kind of CNN
  - Getting  2D convolution to work in the model
  - Mode collapse was the biggest issue to overcome
  - Similarity between classes and image resolution 
  - Original architecture can be to blame (multiply Label and image before convolution)
  - Testing on new discriminator with bigger resolution images.
